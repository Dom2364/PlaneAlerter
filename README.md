This program uses the AircraftList.json file generated by Virtual Radar Server to retrieve current aircraft information from the radar, and compares each aircraft's data with specified conditions. If a condition matches the aircraft data, an email alert will be sent to one or more email addresses with the aircraft's data and a map with the track of the aircraft if available. A log is also kept of every alert in alerts.log, containing all aircraft data in json format and the time sent.
